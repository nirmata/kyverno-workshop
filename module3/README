## Task 1

Study the policy `require-labels.yaml` and answer the below questions.

In what mode is this policy configured?

What resource(s) does this rule match?

Apply the `require-labels.yaml` policy to your cluster.

```sh
k apply -f require-labels.yaml
```

Get all ClusterPolicy resources and ensure it reports ready.

```sh
k get cpol
```

Apply the `ns.yaml` resource to your cluster.

```sh
k apply -f ns.yaml
```

What happened and why?

Fix then re-apply the Namespace resource defined in `ns.yaml` so it passes the policy.

## Task 2

As a member of the SRE team, you have received a request from management
to place restrictions on the type of workloads in the `warehouse` Namespace.
Specifically, they wish to control the use of ServiceAccounts in that Namespace
to only permit ones which are custom thus disallowing use of any defaults.

Modify the incomplete `check-sa.yaml` ClusterPolicy so it does two things:

1. Only applies to the `warehouse` Namespace
2. Prevents Pods from using the `default` named ServiceAccount

**NOTE**: Do not use deprecated fields in a resource spec. Do not change the policy type.

Use the `sa-pod.yaml` resource to test your policy to ensure it blocks the Pod.

After ensuring your policy is effective in blocking the Pod, perform the necessary
steps in the cluster to prove a "good" Pod can be successfully created. Once performing
those steps, modify the `sa-pod.yaml` resource as necessary and re-apply until the Pod is allowed
to be created.

**HINT**: You should not modify the policy at this point.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Task 3

Modify the `check-sa` ClusterPolicy to change the mode to `audit` instead.

Modify the `sa-pod.yaml` resource manifest so it now does use the `default` ServiceAccount.
Change the name of the Pod so as to not create a conflict with the existing one (if present).

Apply the `sa-pod.yaml` resource manifest. It should be allowed.

Describe the PolicyReport resource in the `warehouse` Namespace to understand what it shows.

```sh
k -n warehouse describe polr polr-ns-warehouse
```

Clean up all policies from this lab.

```sh
k delete cpol --all
```
